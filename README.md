# Many-Time-Pad-Break
The ciphertexts are the encryption of eight English sentences using a one-time pad using the same
key.The objective is to figure out the complete plaintexts. All sentences have the same length, and
only use English letters and spaces. Neither punctuation nor special characters were used. Each
byte of the ciphertext is written in hexadecimal format.
To solve this problem, a program was writthen to identify the possible locations of spaces, then
use them to identify letters in other sentences. At the very end,guess the
remaining characters.
